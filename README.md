This project demonstrates a robust data backup and recovery solution using Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) Snapshots. It leverages the native capabilities of AWS to protect critical business data, ensure rapid recovery from failures, and support scalability and compliance requirements.
**Key Features**
1. Incremental Snapshots: Efficient point-in-time backups of EBS volumes.
2. Automated Backup Scheduling: Regular snapshot creation using automation tools.
3. Data Encryption: Secure snapshots and volumes using AWS KMS.
4. Access Management: IAM-based role and permission control.
5. Cross-Region Recovery: Snapshots support data restoration across regions/accounts.
6. Disaster Recovery: Rapid restoration of data in the event of failures.

**Technologies Used**
1. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
2. Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)
3. Amazon EBS Snapshots
4. AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)
5. AWS KMS (Key Management Service)
6. AWS CloudWatch (for monitoring and alerts)
7. AWS CLI / AWS Management Console

**1. Introduction to EBS Snapshots**
Persistent, block-level storage volumes used with EC2.
Supports high availability and performance within availability zones.

**2. Benefits of EBS Snapshots**
Cost-efficient incremental backups
High availability and low latency
Easy scalability and reliability
Secure storage with encryption support

**3. Data Restoration Process**
Create a volume from a snapshot.
Attach the volume to an EC2 instance.
Initialize and mount the volume via GUI or CLI to access data.

**4. Security Measures**
Encrypt snapshots during creation using AWS KMS.
Use IAM policies to restrict snapshot access and actions.
Monitor snapshot activity with CloudWatch.

**5. Use Cases**
Disaster Recovery: Restore EBS volumes from recent snapshots after system failures.
Data Migration: Move snapshot-based volumes across AWS regions/accounts.
Compliance: Ensure audit readiness and regulatory adherence through consistent backups.

This project presents a scalable and secure solution for data backup and recovery using AWS EBS Snapshots. It ensures business continuity, data protection, and operational efficiency by leveraging AWS-native tools and best practices.
